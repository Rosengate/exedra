ExÃ©dra
======
A multi-tier ~~nestable~~ nestful routing oriented PHP Framework.
p/s : still in development.

Introduction
======
This ~~simple nano (smaller than micro?)~~ framework will first focus mainly on nestable route mapping, route-parameter based execution and which hopefully will provide much much modular application execution. Features and example will soon be provided.

History
======
The first unreleased version of exedra has quite constraining ungroupable routing capability, and has a lot of static usage. This version was intended to fix them, give more (self-proclaimed) powerful multi-tier nestable routing ability and hopefully will adapt to modern web development practices.

Documentation
======
Documentation and the homebase for exedra is currently hosted here : http://exedra.rosengate.com

Examples
======
Some of the projects built on top of exedra :

http://github.com/rosengate/exedra-web (hosted at exedra.rosengate.com)

http://github.com/eimihar/persona (hosted at persona.rosengate.com)

Development
======
Some components have been built, such as MVC and URL builder, session, validator, form helper et cetera. Refer documentation for latest updates.

Receptions
======
I am not sure if developers like this kind of routing (multi-tier nestable groupable route-mapping buzz w). Please do send me email at newrehmi@gmail.com whether you like it or not, or mail me there too if there're any suggestions. Thank you. ;D
