Ex√©dra
======
A multi-tier nestable routing PHP Framework.

Introduction
======
This simple framework will first focus mainly on nestable route mapping, route-parameter based execution and which hopefully will provide much much modular application execution. Features and example will soon be provided.

History
======
The first unreleased version of exedra has quite constraining ungroupable routing capability, and has a lot of static usage. This version was intended to fix them, give more (self-claimed) powerful multi-tier nestable routing ability and hopefully will adept to modern web development practices.

Development
======
Still highly in development, and visioning for proper direction. But the basic route-mapping and execution concept was there. Will later adept to PSR thingy, once everything is here. You may try, and see if you like it.
