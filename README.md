Ex√©dra
======
A multi-tier nestful routing oriented PHP Framework.

Introduction
======
This PHP framework focuses mainly on nestable route mapping, route oriented based execution and which hopefully will provide much modular application execution. Route is unique, and identified by name. Imagine developing an application hierarchically down the depth without losing the identity of the executions you planned, while stacking middlewares down the path on every possible node of route.

History
======
The first unreleased version of exedra has so much constraining ungroupable routing capability, and has a lot of static usages (which is extremely violating). This version was intended to fix them, give more controllable multi-tier nestable routing ability and hopefully would adapt to modern web development practices, while staying simple, flexible and contextual at the same time.

Installation
